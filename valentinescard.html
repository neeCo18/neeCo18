            <p>I was thinking about everything we’ve been through lately, and it hit me how much I’ve come to rely on
                you. You aren’t just someone I love; you’re the person who makes the good days better and the hard days
                actually manageable. Thank you for being my constant, my confidant, and my favorite place to come home
                to. Happy Valentine’s Day—I can't wait for all the chapters we haven't written yet <br><br> - Niko Go
